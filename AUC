The Area Under the Curve (AUC) is the measure of the ability of a classifier to distinguish between classes and is used as a summary of the ROC curve. The higher the AUC, the better the performance of the model at distinguishing between the positive and negative classes
We were given to work with AUC as we had to predict probability that somebody will experience financial distress in the next two years , for these kinds of problems AUC works well
Here we could have also thought of using accuracy, precision, recall , F1score or Confusion matrix
